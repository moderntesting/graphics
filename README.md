# Graphics and Logos
This repo contains all of the images and graphics for the podcast. I recently closed the AB Testing cafe press store. In addition to cafepress still looking like a 90's web site, we didn't take a profit on the sales (by choice), but I still felt like their markup was too much.

So - I'm sharing everything here under creative common license - you're welcome to use any of this in your own presentations, web sites, or even to make your own merch.

I should point out that all of these graphics (along with the Angry Weasel.com logo) were all created by the extremely talented [Alexa Pille](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexahorn/) (ne√© Horn) who I met through Matt Barcomb - who suggested Alexa at a Telerik conference many years ago.
